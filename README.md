# groupus

Generates balanced groups from a set of individuals while attempting to maximize the satisfaction of weighted preferences (friendship) among them.

Basically a web based interface for *Stable Roommate Generalised* by *[Anjay Goel](anjaygoel.github.io)*.

*Definitely a ROTS\* project*

## 🛝 Demo instance

https://groupus.fly.dev/

Enter some comma-separated names (don't forget the comma after the last name), set the desired size of the resulting groups/clusters, drag the names to the preference fields and click "Create groups". 

The maximum score for friendship preferences is 10.0. 

Groups can be regenerated, often resulting in different compositions and different scores.

## Setup

```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) flask run --debug
```

Static assets for production are currently included in the repo. To regenerate these files:

```bash
npm run build
# or
npm run watch
```
